#1. List keeps order
#eg:

#2. List is Heterogeneous , because list supports different data types

#3. List supports duplication

#4. list supports looping (for)

#5. List is mutable

#6. List supports both indexing and slicing,hence list supports length function (len) also

# list supports element wise updation in indexing and slicing
#eg: indexing , l=[1,2,3,4,5]
#                l[0]=100
#                print(l)
#                output-[100,2,3,4,5]

#eg: slicing ,  l=[1,2,3,4,5]
#               l[:3]=[7,8]
#               print(l)
#               output- [7,8,3,4,5]

#eg: slicing ,  l=[1,2,3,4,5,6]
#               l[:5]=[7,8]
#               print(l)
#               output- [7,8,6]

#7. List supports nesting
#eg: l=[1,2,3,[4,5,6]]
#   output- [1,2,3,[4,5,6]]

#8. List comprehension supports only in list
