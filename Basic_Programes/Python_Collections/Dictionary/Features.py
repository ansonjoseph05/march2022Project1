# 1. Keeps order

# 2. Heterogeneous

# 3. Values support duplication

# 4. Keys does not support duplication

# 5. When iterating elements with print(i) we only get keys not values (eg: key is name and value is anu )
      #for i in dict1
      #   print(i)

# 6. when iterating elements with print(dict1(i)) we only get values
      #for i in dict1
      #    print(dict1(i))

# 7. Does not support indexing
