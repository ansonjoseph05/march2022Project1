# tuple unpacking
# t=1,2,3
# a,b,c=t     # a,b,c=1,2,3
# print(a)
# print(b)

# tuple unpacking concept in swapping

# n1=1
# n2=10
# n1,n2=n2,n1              # here the first n1 and n2 are tuple ,at first the value of n1 get transfered to second n2 
                           # and first n2 get transfered to second n1

t1=(100,200,300)
