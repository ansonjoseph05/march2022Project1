#1. Set doesnt keep order ,
# eg: input - {1,2,3,4,5}
# output-{2,4,1,3,5}

#2. Set is heterogeneous, because set supports different data types including int,string,float,boolean

#3. Set doesnt support duplication
#eg: s={1,2,3,4,3,2}
     #output- {1,2,3,4}

#4. Set supports looping (for ...)

#5. If True is entered in the set then the value 1 will not be printed also with false 0 will not be printed since they are boolean

#6. Set is mutable ,because set can be updated, means we can add and remove values from set
#datas which cannot be updated are called immutable

#7. Set doesnt support string indexing and string slicing,hence does not support length function also

#8. Set does not support nesting
#eg: s={1,2,3,{4,5,6}}
    #output- error (unhashable type)
